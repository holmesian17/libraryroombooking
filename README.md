# libraryroombooking

This sets out to correct some problems we've had with library room booking consistency.
The goal is for the program to walk the user through the steps and questions for a booking.
The program saves the answers to these questions to an excel document in the next empty row.
From here, it will add an event to the Outlook meeting room calendar with the specifications
and information from the program. This should cut down on steps, save paper, and make it easier
to compile room stats at the end of each month.
